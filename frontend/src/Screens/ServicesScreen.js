Our first visit is more like detailed cleaning. Before we can begin a regularly scheduled cleaning of a home there are a variety of first-time tasks that require extra time and effort. If we do not get rid of the old dirt, no matter how hard we try, simply removing the new dirt will not make your home sparkle. It is common for us to spend from two to four times longer on a first-time cleaning than it takes us on regular, repeat maintenance visit.</p>
